emulino is a very basic AVR ATMEGA emulator

The list of things it gets wrong and doesn't support is probably
longer than the list of things that work properly.

On the bright side it can still be useful for rapid testing of
code changes without having to upload anything to hardware.

As long as you don't care about all sorts of actually useful
things, like PWM, or using the ADC, or the timing being at all
accurate.

Things that work
 * USART
 * Digital I/O

Things that don't work
 * ADC
 * PWM
 * SPI/I2C
 * Anything timing related
